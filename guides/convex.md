# Convex Guide

Convex is the backend for this project. It replaces what was previously a frontend-only data layer (Legend-State + IndexedDB) with a real server: a reactive database, server-side functions, authentication, and HTTP endpoints — all managed as code in the `convex/` directory.

## What Convex Does

Think of Convex as a backend-as-a-service that speaks WebSocket. Instead of REST endpoints that you poll, Convex **pushes** data to the client in real time. When a chat message is saved to the database, every connected client viewing that chat sees it instantly — no refetching.

The key pieces:

- **Schema** (`convex/schema.ts`) — defines tables and indexes, like a database migration
- **Queries** (`*_queries.ts`) — read-only functions that subscribe to data changes
- **Mutations** (`*_mutations.ts`) — write functions that modify the database
- **Actions** (`*_actions.ts`) — side-effect functions that can call external APIs
- **HTTP actions** (`convex/http.ts`) — traditional HTTP endpoints (we use these for SSE streaming)
- **Auth** (`convex/auth.ts`) — authentication via `@convex-dev/auth` (anonymous + password providers)

All of these are TypeScript files in `convex/`. When you run `npx convex dev`, Convex watches this directory and hot-deploys changes automatically.

## Cloud vs. Local Development

Convex offers two modes for development:

- **Cloud deployment** — your dev backend runs on Convex's servers. Data lives in the cloud, and you access the dashboard at [dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev/). Requires a Convex account.
- **Local deployment** (BETA) — your dev backend runs entirely on your machine. Data lives in a `.convex/` folder in your project directory. No account needed, no network round-trips, faster iteration. You manage environment variables via the CLI (`npx convex env set`) instead of the web dashboard.

Both modes use the same `npx convex dev` command. The choice is stored in `.env.local`, and all subsequent `npx convex dev` runs use whatever mode is configured there. Here's what `.env.local` looks like for each:

**Cloud** — URLs point to Convex's servers:

```plaintext
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:<your-project-slug>
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://<your-project-slug>.convex.cloud
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=https://<your-project-slug>.convex.site
```

**Local** — URLs point to localhost:

```plaintext
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=local:<your-local-slug>
VITE_CONVEX_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3210
VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3211
```

Similarly, `npx convex dashboard` opens the appropriate dashboard based on `.env.local` — the cloud dashboard for cloud deployments, or a local dashboard for local deployments.

**Switching between modes:** Delete `.env.local` and run `npx convex dev` again. You'll be prompted to create a new project or choose an existing one (including any you've created before, local or cloud).

> **Important: Local deployment is required for Mastra integration.** The Mastra dev server runs on `localhost:4111`. With a cloud Convex deployment, actions execute on Convex's remote servers and cannot reach `localhost` on your machine — requests to `http://localhost:4111` will fail with "forbidden". With a local deployment, the Convex backend runs on your machine alongside Mastra, so actions can reach it. If you don't need Mastra (i.e., you only use normal chat, not deep research), either deployment mode works fine.

## First-Time Dev Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This installs both frontend and Convex dependencies (they share a single `package.json`).

### 2. Initialize Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

The first time you run this, Convex walks you through setup:

1. **Create or choose a project** — you'll be asked whether to create a new project or choose an existing one. If creating new, pick a name (the repo name works fine).
2. **Cloud or local** — you'll be asked to choose between a cloud deployment and a local deployment (BETA). See [Cloud vs. Local Development](#cloud-vs-local-development) above for the differences.
3. **Log in** (cloud only) — if you chose cloud, Convex opens a browser tab to authenticate with your Convex account (create one at [convex.dev](https://www.convex.dev/) if you don't have one). Local deployments skip this step entirely.
4. **Generate `.env.local`** — Convex writes `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`, `VITE_CONVEX_URL`, and `VITE_CONVEX_SITE_URL` to `.env.local`.

> **Shortcut:** If you want to skip the cloud/local prompt and go straight to a local deployment (without creating an account), run `npx convex dev --local` instead.

After setup, the dev server watches `convex/` for changes and deploys them automatically. It also generates the `convex/_generated/` directory containing typed API references.

### 3. Generate Auth Keys

`@convex-dev/auth` needs a JWT key pair to sign session tokens. Open another terminal and run:

```bash
npx @convex-dev/auth
```

This generates `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` and automatically stores them on your Convex deployment (whether cloud or local).

### 4. Set Environment Variables

In addition to `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` (set by Step 3), you need to set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` and `SITE_URL`. You can set them through the dashboard UI or the CLI — both work the same way for cloud and local deployments (they target whichever deployment is configured in `.env.local`).

**Via the dashboard:**

```bash
npx convex dashboard
```

This opens the dashboard for your current deployment (cloud or local). Go to **Settings** > **Environment Variables** and add the variables listed below.

**Via the CLI:**

```bash
npx convex env set SITE_URL http://localhost:5173
npx convex env set OPENROUTER_API_KEY your-openrouter-api-key
```

**You need these four variables set on your Convex deployment:**

| Variable             | Value                                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`    | The private key from Step 3                                                                                   |
| `JWKS`               | The public key JSON from Step 3                                                                               |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Your OpenRouter API key (for server-side AI calls)                                                            |
| `SITE_URL`           | `http://localhost:5173` (required by `@convex-dev/auth`)                                                      |
| `MASTRA_URL`         | `http://localhost:4111` (Mastra server for research)                                                          |
| `AUTH_RESEND_KEY`    | Resend API key for email verification and password reset                                                      |
| `AUTH_EMAIL`         | Sender address, e.g. `Chat Template <noreply@yourdomain.com>` (optional, defaults to `onboarding@resend.dev`) |

You can set `MASTRA_URL` via the CLI instead of the dashboard:

```bash
npx convex env set MASTRA_URL http://localhost:4111
```

You can verify all variables are set with `npx convex env list`.

### 5. Start the Dev Servers

Run both servers together:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This uses `concurrently` to start the Convex backend and Vite frontend in one terminal. You can also run them separately:

```bash
pnpm run dev:backend    # starts Convex dev server
pnpm run dev:frontend   # starts Vite dev server (in another terminal)
```

To inspect data and run functions, open the dashboard:

```bash
npx convex dashboard
```

The app should load, show the auth page where you can sign in or continue as a guest, and then start chatting.

### 6. Run Backend Tests

```bash
pnpm run test:convex
```

These tests use `convex-test` which simulates the Convex runtime locally — no deployed project needed.

## How the Code Is Organized

Each domain (chats, messages) follows the same file pattern:

```plaintext
convex/
├── schema.ts              # Aggregates all table definitions
├── lib.ts                 # Auth-wrapped function builders (queryWithAuth, etc.)
├── auth.ts                # Anonymous auth config
├── auth.config.ts         # Auth provider configuration
├── http.ts                # HTTP router (CORS, auth middleware)
├── http_helpers.ts        # Shared helpers (auto-title)
├── http_chat.ts           # SSE streaming endpoint (normal chat)
├── http_research.ts       # SSE streaming endpoint (research via Mastra)
│
├── chats_schema.ts        # Table definition + validators
├── chats_guards.ts        # Ownership checks (throws 403/404)
├── chats_helpers.ts       # Pure DB operations (no auth logic)
├── chats_queries.ts       # Public read functions
├── chats_mutations.ts     # Public write functions
├── chats_actions.ts       # Side-effect functions (AI title suggestion)
│
├── messages_schema.ts     # Same pattern for messages
├── messages_guards.ts
├── messages_helpers.ts
├── messages_queries.ts
├── messages_mutations.ts
├── messages_internals.ts  # Internal functions (used by HTTP actions)
│
├── test.setup.ts          # Test helpers + module glob for convex-test
├── chats.test.ts          # Backend tests
└── messages.test.ts
```

The layering is: **guards** check authorization, **helpers** do the DB work, **queries/mutations** wire them together with auth. This separation means guards are reusable and helpers are testable without auth.

## Going to Production

### 1. Create a Production Convex Deployment

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This creates a production deployment (separate from your dev deployment) and deploys all functions and schema to it. The first time, it will prompt you to choose between creating a new production deployment or using an existing one.

### 2. Set Production Environment Variables

On the Convex dashboard, switch to your **production** deployment and set:

| Variable             | Value                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`    | Same private key (or generate a new pair for production)                 |
| `JWKS`               | Matching public key JSON                                                 |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Your production OpenRouter API key                                       |
| `SITE_URL`           | Your production URL (e.g., `https://myapp.netlify.app`)                  |
| `MASTRA_URL`         | Your deployed Mastra server URL                                          |
| `AUTH_RESEND_KEY`    | Resend API key for email verification and password reset                 |
| `AUTH_EMAIL`         | Sender address, e.g. `Chat Template <noreply@yourdomain.com>` (optional) |

### 3. Get Your Deploy Key

For CI/CD (GitHub Actions), you need a deploy key:

1. Go to [dashboard.convex.dev](https://dashboard.convex.dev/)
2. Select your project > **Settings** > **Deploy Key**
3. Copy the key

### 4. Add the Deploy Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repo > **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
2. Add a new repository secret:

| Secret name         | Value                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` | The deploy key from Step 3 |

### 5. How CI/CD Deploys

The CD workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`) uses a single command that deploys Convex functions **and** builds the frontend:

```bash
npx convex deploy --cmd 'pnpm run build'
```

This does two things in order:

1. Deploys all Convex functions and schema to the production deployment
2. Runs `pnpm run build` which builds the Vite app with the production `VITE_CONVEX_URL` (injected by Convex)

The `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable authenticates the deploy without interactive login.

## Common Issues

**"VITE_CONVEX_URL is not set"** — You haven't run `npx convex dev` yet, or `.env.local` is missing. Run `npx convex dev` to generate it.

**"Not authenticated" errors in the app** — The anonymous auth provider may not be configured. Check that `convex/auth.ts` exports the anonymous provider and that `SITE_URL` is set. For cloud deployments, check the dashboard. For local deployments, verify with `npx convex env list`.

**Functions not updating** — Make sure `npx convex dev` is running. It watches `convex/` and auto-deploys. If it crashed, restart it.

**Backend tests fail with "module not found"** — Run `npx convex dev` once to generate `convex/_generated/`. The test runner needs these generated files.

**"Schema mismatch" on deploy** — Your local schema differs from what's deployed. This usually means someone else deployed a different schema. Run `npx convex dev` to sync, resolve any conflicts, then redeploy.

**Want to switch between cloud and local?** — Delete `.env.local` and run `npx convex dev` again. You'll be prompted to create a new project or choose an existing one (you can pick a project you created before in either mode).
